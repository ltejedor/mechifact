Float Tank Therapy at Reboot Float & Cryo Spa\n   What it is: Sensory deprivation tanks where you float effortlessly in water saturated with Epsom salt in complete darkness and silence.\n   Why it's weird: You're essentially paying to be put in a dark, silent pod filled with salt water to 'reset' your nervous system\u2014like temporary, voluntary solitary confinement that people love.\n\n4. Kundalini Yoga for Breaking Bad Habits at The Center SF\n   What it is: A spiritual practice using breathing techniques, mantras, mudras, and kriyas to awaken energy at the base of the spine.\n   Why it's weird: You'll be doing rapid breathing, chanting, and repetitive physical movements designed to release 'serpent energy' along your spine.\n\n5. Cryotherapy Session\n   What it is: Step into a chamber cooled to -200\u00b0F for 2-3 minutes to reduce inflammation and boost recovery.\n   Why it's weird: You're voluntarily subjecting yourself to sub-arctic temperatures in minimal clothing for alleged health benefits\u2014like an extreme ice bath but way more sci-fi.\n",
